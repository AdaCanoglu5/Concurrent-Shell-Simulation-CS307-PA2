# Concurrent-Shell-simulation-in-C
In this project i have created a Shell simulator that reads multiple Linux commands from a file and executes them concurrently using multiple threads and processes that communicate via piped file descriptors. Synchronization is achieved with the usage of piped file descriptors and mutexes for threads.
